- ## College Facebook Search

    ([demo](/search/)) ([code](https://github.com/bnprks/people-search))

    I wrote this as a faster version of Princeton's internal student directory. It downloads all the student data to the client so that searches can be executed instantly as the user types. The site with current data is available [here](http://princetonfacebook.com) with a Princeton student login, but the public demo uses fake generated data.

- ## Flood It Game

    <img src="/flood-it-screenshot.png" height="300px" style="float: right;margin: 0em 1em 1em 1em" />

    ([demo](/flood-it/)) ([code](https://github.com/bnprks/flood-it))

    This was my first clojurescript project. It is a remake of a simple puzzle game called
    Flood It built using re-frame/reagent.
