- ###College Facebook Search
<img src="/search-screenshot.png" height="300px" />

([demo](/search/))

I wrote this as a faster version of Princeton's internal student directory. It downloads all the student data to the client so that searches can be executed instantly as the user types. The site with current data is available [here](http://princetonfacebook.com) with a Princeton student login, but the public demo uses fake generated data.
